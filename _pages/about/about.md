***

My name is **Javier Estraviz** and I’m a Data Engineer.

I work in 🔬 [Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/), the open-access publisher of scientific journals (the 6th largest academic publisher and 3rd most-cited publisher, January 2024).

Before that, I worked in 👚 [Lookiero](https://lookiero.es/), also as a Data Engineer. Lookiero is an online Personal Shopper service, present in many European countries.

Even before that, I was a Technical Program Manager at 🎟️ [StubHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StubHub), an  [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/) company for many years.

Previously, I was the IT Recruiter of 🎫 [Ticketbis](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ticketbis), the Spanish startup ticketing marketplace acquired by eBay in 2016.

Back in the years, I occupied various positions (from Programmer to Team Lead) in several 👔 consulting firms (everybody has a past!).
