Today I will leave here an entry about the 2015 conference by [**Peter Goodliffe**](http://www.goodliffe.net/){:target="_blank"}, which is titled *Becoming a Better Programmer*. Something that, *a priori*, should be the goal of every software developer passionate about his profession (<span class="glossary"><a href="#" class="tooltip-right" data-tooltip="{{site.data.glossary.IMHO}}">IMHO</a></span>). **Peter** has a [book published by O'Reilly](https://www.amazon.es/Becoming-Better-Programmer-Handbook-People/dp/1491905530/){:target="_blank"} in 2014, with the same title.

This time, first the video and then some notes on it:

I have to confess that although the message and purpose of the talk fit with what I expected to hear, after completing the visualization I was not too enthusiastic. However, I emphasize the idea that **Peter** strives to make clear:

> "It's all about ATTITUDE"

The attitude is determinant in the professional career (and in life), also for a programmer. The 46 minutes of talk have also served to discuss topics related to learning models:

* The [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efecto_Dunning-Kruger){:target="_blank"}: cognitive bias by which subjects with little knowledge or skills are believed to be better and smarter than others who are much better trained or prepared.
* The [Dreyfus model of skill acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition){:target="_blank"} (stages: _Novice -> Advanced Beginner -> Competent -> Proficient -> Expert_).
* The [_Knowledge Portfolio_](http://flylib.com/books/en/1.315.1.18/1/){:target="_blank"} (see [_The Pragmatic Programmer_](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer){:target="_blank"}).
* The 5 stages of learning: _Denial, Anger, Negotiation, Depression and Acceptance_.
* *Yes*, in this video (*as in many others*) [**Malcolm Gladwell**](http://gladwell.com/){:target="_blank"} is quoted, the journalist and lecturer who popularized, in his work [_Outliers_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)){:target="_blank"}, the thesis that it is necessary a dedication of around 10,000 hours in the practice of a subject to reach a level of mastery in that matter.

That said, an interesting video but ... I expected it better. 

*Regards!*
