I currently have unlimited access to an enormous amount of books and videos through [safaribooksonline](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/){:target="_blank"}. The paradise for anyone interested in software development. So, days ago, I thought of downloading a "light" videocourse that I could follow while commuting to work by tube. This [*Domain-Driven Design Distilled*](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/domain-driven-design-distilled/9780134593449/){:target="_blank"} is not exactly light in content, but at least I do not need to be in front of a code editor to follow.

The course is taught by [**Vaughn Vernon**](https://vaughnvernon.co/){:target="_blank"}, author of the book [*Implementing Domain-Driven Design*](https://www.amazon.es/Implementing-Domain-Driven-Design-VaughnVernon/dp/0321834577/){:target="_blank"} of 2013, that had continuation last year with the book that gives name to the course that I have seen. My first approach to [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design){:target="_blank"} and without going through the already classic volume by [**Eric Evans**](https://twitter.com/ericevans0){:target="_blank"}, [*Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software*](https://www.amazon.es/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/){:target="_blank"} (2003). This remains pending for me later (*for much later, I would say*).

The *Distilled* version hasn't excited me much, *to be honest*, but it aroused some interest to me. It is for this reason that I keep as pending to read this reduced version of the same subject:
[*Domain-Driven Design Quickly*](https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/domain-driven-design-quickly){:target="_blank"}, which can be downloaded for free from [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/){:target="_blank"}. 

To conclude, here we have an extract from the explanation of what is DDD, which we can read in [DDD Comunity](http://dddcommunity.org/){:target="_blank"}:

> Domain-driven design (DDD) is an approach to developing software for complex needs by deeply connecting the implementation to an evolving model of the core business concepts. Its premise is:
> 
> - Place the projectâ€™s primary focus on the core domain and domain logic.
Base complex designs on a model.
> - Initiate a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively cut ever closer to the conceptual heart of the problem.  
>
> The premise is simple, but pulling it off in the messy real world is hard. It calls for new skills and discipline, and a systematic approach.
> Domain-driven design is not a technology or a methodology. DDD provides a structure of practices and terminology for making design decisions that focus and accelerate software projects dealing with complicated domains.
