After thinking for a while, I have decided that having a personal blog makes sense to me if it serves the purpose for which I have created it: not only to spend some time configuring it, creating it and hosting it on github, but also to register what activities occupy my free time dedicated to self-training, in topics of Web Development and/or Data Science. 

That is why I will try to get into the routine of watching a technical talk, of medium duration (usually < 1 h), every day. I'm starting today with this from [**Ken Mugrage**](https://kenmugrage.com/){:target="_blank"} that deals with _Continuous Delivery_ and _Continuous Deployment_ (for a clear explanation of the difference between these two terms, it may be a good idea to [read this](https://puppet.com/blog/continuous-delivery-vs-continuous-deployment-what-s-diff){:target="_blank"}).

Let's see if after a few days I continue with the "experiment". In any case, I will have gained something valuable ;)
