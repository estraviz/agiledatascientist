I currently work as Scrum Master & Project Manager at [StubHub](http://stubhub.com), an [eBay](http://ebay.com) company. Previously, I was the IT Recruiter of [Ticketbis](https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/stubhub-to-expand-its-global-reach-into-47-markets-with-the-acquisition-of-ticketbis/), the Spanish startup ticketing marketplace acquired by eBay in 2016. I worked also as Programmer/Analyst/Team Lead in consulting firms (*everybody has a past!* :)
